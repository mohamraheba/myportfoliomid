My webpage consists of various content sections enclosed in div elements with specific classes for styling. 
These sections include a header with navigation links, a personal introduction under the "About Me" section,
a "Resume" section detailing work experience and skills, a "Works" section showcasing projects with images
and descriptions, a "Gallery" section for images, and a "Contact" section with contact information. 
The code also includes links to external resources like the resume and external social media profiles.
The CSS file contains rules for styling the layout, fonts, colors, and spacing. The website incorporates
responsive design principles, as indicated by the viewport meta tag, making it suitable for various device screen sizes.
